Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) Implementation

This project aims to implement the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm for continuous control tasks in a deep learning course setting. It will provide students with hands-on experience in applying reinforcement learning to solve real-world problems.

Project Objectives:

    Understand the theoretical foundations of DDPG, including actor-critic architecture, experience replay, and soft target updates.
    Implement DDPG from scratch using TensorFlow or PyTorch, including the actor and critic networks, the replay buffer, and the training loop.
    Evaluate the performance of DDPG on various continuous control environments, such as OpenAI Gym environments.
    Analyze the training process and explore strategies for hyperparameter tuning.
    Compare DDPG to other reinforcement learning algorithms for continuous control.
